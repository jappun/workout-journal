# Workout Journal

This is a project I made for CPSC 210 at UBC.  

### User Stories


- As a user, I want to be able to add a new workouts to my list of workouts.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a workout and view the details (name, sets, reps) of all the exercises in it.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new exercise to my workout.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an exercise from my workout.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of the application to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load the state of the application from file.


*NOTE: Currently, the GUI does not support having a list of workouts. Instead, it consists of one workout only. 
Future versions of this application would aim to support having multiple workouts.*
